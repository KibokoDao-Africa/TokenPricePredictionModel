## Project Overview

This project is about predicting the future closing prices of tokens in the blockchain space using a sequence model implemented in Python.

A sequence model is a type of machine learning model that's great for making predictions based on a series of data points. In this project, we use it to analyze historical token prices and predict future ones.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you need to have python 3.11 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing python, you can clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
juptyer notebook token_price_prediction.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter notebook in your browser, where you can see the code and run it to make predictions.
